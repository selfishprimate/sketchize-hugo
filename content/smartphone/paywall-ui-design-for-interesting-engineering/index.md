I'm thrilled to present my latest project showcasing a modern approach to paywall design, specifically crafted for Interesting Engineering. Leveraging the power of Google Material Design System, I've meticulously designed two alternative screens, each tailored to enhance user experience and captivate attention.

In the first design alternative, I've integrated the elegance of Material Design into a standard web page format. A sleek header, intuitive navigational bar leading to subcategories, and strategically placed elements like search, subscribe, and sign-in buttons create a seamless user journey.

The second design takes a bold step towards minimalism. Stripping away unnecessary elements, this popup screen immerses users directly into the payment process. By eliminating distractions, the design emphasizes the user's focus on the crucial task at hand—entering payment details.

Thank you for your time, and I hope these designs inspire innovative solutions in the realm of digital interfaces.
