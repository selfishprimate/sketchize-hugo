### Overview

The advanced search functionality for Joi Gifts was designed to significantly improve user experience by implementing several key enhancements aimed at simplifying the gift discovery process and increasing user engagement. These designs were created for both desktop and mobile platforms to ensure a consistent and seamless user experience across all devices.

### Objectives

1. Increase user focus and efficiency during search interactions.
2. Reduce task load on users by providing quick access to recent searches.
3. Utilize social proof to guide users to popular products.
4. Enhance user retention and engagement through recently viewed products.
5. Streamline the search process with autofill and smart suggestion features.

### Design Process

**Research:** Conducted comprehensive research, primarily focusing on competitor analysis and heuristic evaluation, to identify pain points and opportunities for improvement in the existing search functionality. Through thorough examination of competitor platforms and heuristic evaluation, key pain points were discovered, guiding the design process towards addressing these critical areas for enhancement.

**Wireframing:** Created wireframes to visualize the layout and flow of the enhanced search features, including the backdrop component, recent searches, popular products list, and recently viewed products.

**Prototyping:** Developed interactive prototypes to test with users, stakeholders, and conduct guerrilla testing sessions to collect valuable feedback and insights. By engaging stakeholders in guerrilla testing sessions, we were able to gather real-time data and iterate on the designs based on direct feedback, ensuring the final implementation met the needs and expectations of all stakeholders involved.

**Iteration:** Iterated on the designs based on user feedback, refining the layout, visual design, and interaction patterns to optimize user experience.

**UI Design:** Designed high-fidelity UI mockups that seamlessly integrated the new features into the Joi Gifts brand aesthetic, ensuring consistency and coherence across the platform.

### Key Features

**Backdrop Component**: This feature enhances user focus by dimming the background when users start typing in the search box. By reducing visual distractions, the backdrop component helps users concentrate on their search queries, leading to a more streamlined and efficient search experience.

**Recent Searches**: Implemented a section right below the search box displaying users' recent searches. This allows users to quickly access their previous search queries without having to retype them, significantly reducing the task load and saving time. This feature enhances user convenience and encourages repeated interactions with the search functionality.

**Autofill and Related Products**: Integrated an autofill functionality that suggests search queries as users type. This predictive feature reduces the effort required to type full search terms, speeding up the search process and helping users find what they are looking for more efficiently.

Additionally, a list of **related products** is displayed based on the user's input, offering relevant suggestions that can help users discover new items that match their interests. By anticipating user needs and providing related product recommendations, this feature enhances the overall usability and effectiveness of the search functionality.

This feature analyzes user interactions and past searches to offer relevant product suggestions, making the search process more personalized and effective. By delivering smart suggestions, users are more likely to discover products that match their interests and needs.
