This project was one of the UI challenges that we set for ourselves at **Mobven** on a weekly basis. Back then, the company had a partnership with **Edenred** and employees were paying for their meals with Edenred cards.

As the Design Studio Team (the design team at Mobven), after we experience some real-life problems with payments, defining cards to the system, etc. we’ve decided to design new features and improve some of the current screens.

I’ve combined the results I obtained in some interviews with restaurant owners and customers with the problems I experienced and created some of the following screens in light of these data.

### Payments with OTP

With the **OTP (one-time password)** method, users can make quick and contactless payments with one-time passwords generated through the application.

### Payments with QR code

When the user presses the QR icon in the bottom navigation bar, they will be asked to scan the QR code shown by the restaurant owner. After scanning the code, the confirmation screen opens and the payment process is completed if the user presses the confirmation button.

### Adding a card to the system

Adding one or more cards to the system can be long and painful as the users enter these numbers manually. In addition to manual card number entry, NFC and scanning technologies can ease these processes and reduce the users' task load.

### Sending/receiving money

Users can transfer money to their Edenred cards via using their bank account or their electronic wallet, thus they continue to benefit from Edenred campaigns. In addition to that, user engagement can be increased via features such as money transfers among Edenred users.

### Augmented reality

Users can easily find the Edenred partner restaurants around them. They can reach detailed information about the restaurant by touching the **flashing red dots** on the screen.
