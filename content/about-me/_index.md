When I'm not designing beautiful interfaces, you can find me jamming to my favorite tunes, sketching and drawing, or cruising around on my skateboard.

I've always had a passion for creating and tinkering with things, which is what drew me to the world of UI/UX design. I love the challenge of crafting experiences that are not only functional and intuitive, but also visually appealing and delightful to use.

Aside from my work as a designer, I'm also a big advocate for open-source software and tools. I believe that technology should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or financial means. That's why I'm working on a number of open-source projects that aim to make design and development more accessible to people all over the world.

However, creating open-source products takes time and resources. That's why I've set up a Patreon page where you can support my work and help me continue to create tools and resources that benefit the design community. Your donations will go towards covering the costs of software licenses, hosting fees, and other expenses that come with maintaining and improving these projects.

If you're passionate about design and believe in the power of open-source technology, I'd love your support. Together, we can make the world of design and development more inclusive and accessible for everyone.
