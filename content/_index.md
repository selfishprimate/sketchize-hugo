Hello! I'm Halil, an Istanbul-based UI/UX designer with over 10 years of experience in crafting intuitive and engaging user interfaces. My expertise spans across web and mobile platforms, and I have a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript.

Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of designing for a diverse range of domains, including **online media**, **e-commerce**, **fintech**, **banking**, **travel**, **retail**, **education**, and **technology**. Each project has enriched my skills and deepened my understanding of user-centered design.
