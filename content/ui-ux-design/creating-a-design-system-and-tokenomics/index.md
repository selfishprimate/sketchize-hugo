### Overview
Creating this project for Joi Gifts aimed **to establish a unified design system that ensures consistency and efficiency across all platforms**, including desktop, mobile web, and native applications. The project started with a clear need to streamline design and development processes, ultimately leading to a more cohesive and user-friendly product.

### Objectives
- Establish a comprehensive design system for Joi Gifts.
- Ensure design and usability consistency across all platforms.
- Bridge the gap between design and development teams.
- Create a more efficient workflow, reducing costs and effort in future developments.

### Introduction
The project began with a clear articulation of the need for a design system to the entire team. Explaining that future developments would be more cost-effective and require less effort, I highlighted the importance of achieving consistency in design and usability across Joi Gifts' applications. **This initiative aimed to eliminate the gaps between design and development, creating a more efficient workflow**.

### Research and Incremental Approach
My approach was incrementalist, starting with the essentials and expanding the design system as needed. I began by creating a component checklist, identifying the necessary components for the initial phase and excluding non-essential ones.

### Token Creation
To visualize and understand our design needs, I focused on creating design tokens. Using Figma, I compiled all necessary values for colors, typography, spacing, sizing, shadows, etc., into a single file. The goal was to convert these tokens into a JSON format and share them with developers via GitHub. This method allowed for quick updates in the codebase whenever changes were made to the tokens. I utilized the Token Studio for Figma plugin to create these tokens.

Below, you can see how I've conceptualized some of the design tokens.

### Collaboration and Development
Frequent meetings with developers ensured the successful finalization of this process. With the design tokens in place, I started building the previously identified components for the design system. As Joi Gifts' design and development processes progressed, the design tokens and components were updated as needed.

### Challenges
The primary challenge was convincing the team and business stakeholders to adopt such a system. Although initially costly and effort-intensive, the long-term benefits to the business were invaluable.

### Components
The collaborative efforts of the entire team resulted in a comprehensive design system. This system includes basic components like inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons, and buttons, as well as icons and flags, covering all application needs.

Here you can see some of the components I've created.

### Iconography
In the Joi Gifts Design System, icons play a crucial role in enhancing both functionality and aesthetics. The process of selecting icons was meticulous and collaborative, ensuring both accessibility and visual appeal.

The selection criteria included appropriate **stroke thickness** to ensure clarity at different sizes, and **readability** to ensure each icon clearly conveyed its intended meaning. We also prioritized **accessibility standards**, selecting icons that would be usable and understandable for all users, including those with visual impairments.

Ultimately, **the chosen icons balanced both accessibility and aesthetics**. They not only enhance the user experience by being easily recognizable and interpretable but also contribute to the overall visual harmony of the Joi Gifts applications.

### Country Flags
Country flags are an integral part of the country selection flows in the Joi Gifts applications. They provide users with a clear and recognizable way to select their country, enhancing the overall user experience.

I shared these versatile flag designs with the Figma community, where they have been embraced and utilized by thousands of designers worldwide. This contribution not only supports the design community but also highlights the importance of adaptable and accessible design assets.
