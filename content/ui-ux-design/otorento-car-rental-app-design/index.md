Otorento offers users one of the cheapest and safest ways to rent a car in Turkey. Users rent cars safely using either desktop or mobile websites of Otorento.

The challenge was to analyze the current product, define the well-functioning parts, and find solutions for the problematic ones. In the end, to make a synthesis of all these findings and design a user-centered application for the users.

In the current websites, the search screens were cluttered with unnecessary design elements and the search feature wasn’t offering very much to the users in order to ease their tasks. So, I’ve tried to design a search functionality supported by features like geolocation, latest searches, popular locations, etc.

{{< figure

    alt="Features like popular locations and the latest searches can reduce the users' task load."

Calendar screen where users select the pickup and return dates.

Another challenge was to design a simplistic filtering feature rather than using a complex one due to the limited development resources. But, again, this feature should have covered the basic filtering options like fuel type, body type, gear, etc.

So, I've come up with an idea of a smart “filtering feature with horizontal scrolling that is located at the top of the search results.

    alt="The smart filtering feature can make filtering quick and painless for the users."

The system should support users to use some of the basic functionalities without registering to the system.

{{< figure

    alt="The user can check his/her reservations without logging in to the system."

The system should support users to register to the system easily.

{{< figure

    alt="Users can easily register to the system with a one-time password sent to their phones."

Thank you for watching.
